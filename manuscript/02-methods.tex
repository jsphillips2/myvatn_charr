Mývatn is located in northeastern Iceland (65°40’N 17°00’W) 
and has a tundra-subarctic climate (Björnsson and Jónsson 2004). 
The lake is 37 km2, divided into north (8 km2) and south (29 km2) basins 
connected by a narrow channel (Einarsson et al. 2004). 
Mývatn is shallow (mean depth = 2.3 m) and is fed by cold and 
warms springs rich in phosphorous 
(south basin N and P inputs of 1.4 and 1.5 g m-2 y-1, respectively) (Ólafsson 1979). 
Consequently, the lake has high primary production 
(Ólafsson 1979) that supports large but variable populations of benthic invertebrates 
such as midges and cladocerans 
(Lindegaard and Jónasson 1979, Einarsson and Örnólfsdóttir 2004, Garðarsson et al. 2004). 
The benthic invertebrates are an important food source for Mývatn’s vertebrate populations, 
including Arctic charr, three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), 
brown trout (Salmo trutta), and waterfowl (Einarsson et al. 2004). 

Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) are salmonids with a circumpolar distribution 
and are important consumers in many boreal and arctic lakes (Klemetsen et al. 2003). 
While some charr populations are anadromous (Klemetsen et al. 2003), 
Mývatn’s population to resides strictly within the lake, 
despite a major outflow that connects the lake to the Greenland Sea (Guðbergsson 2004). 
Spawning occurs in the fall among individuals aged 4 years and older. 
There are two charr morphs within Mývatn: “regular” (size at maturation of 35-50cm) 
and “dwarf” (20-25cm). However, the dwarf morph is restricted to a small 
and relatively isolated part of the south basin; therefore, 
the “regular” morph is the focus of this study. 
Gut content data reveal a diverse diet, including midges, snails, clams, zooplankton, 
benthic crustaceans, and sticklebacks. 
The large-bodied cladoceran Eurycercus is thought to be a particularly important prey item 
(Guðbergsson 2004). 
While some charr populations are cannibalistic (Klemetsen et al. 2003), 
especially in the absence of other large-bodied prey (e.g., fish), 
the charr in Mývatn appear to lack cannibalism.

\subsection*{Data} 
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Systematic surveys of Mývatn’s Arctic charr have been conducted 
with gill nets every year from 1986-2017 by a single researcher (G. Guðbergsson) 
using a consistent methodology. 
The surveys largely took place after the period of most dramatic population decline 
(Guðbergsson 2004). Most captured individuals were measured for length, mass, 
age (either based on otoliths or estimated from size), and a binary index of maturity. 
Surveys were conducted at 12 sites around the lake, 
most of which were located in the south basin. 
Surveys were conducted in fall (late August through September) 
of every year (just before spawning) and in June in a subset of years. 
For this analysis we used only the September data. 
Therefore, in our age classifications an individual of age ‘x’ is an individual 
that survived to that age (e.g., an “age 1” individual was born in the previous fall). 
The oldest individuals in the data set were 12 years old, although observations 
of individuals older than 6 years are sparse (Figure S2). 
In Mývatn, charr reach maturity between 4 and 5 years of age, 
and therefore we grouped the older individuals into a single reproductive age class, 
called “adults” or “age 4” for simplicity.

\subsection*{Demographic model} 
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We characterized the demography of the charr popupaltion using an age structured model
with time-varying demographic rates.
The model projected the dynamics from one time step to the next as
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:XPX}
    \mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{P}_{t-1}~\mathbf{x}_{t-1}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathbf{P}_{t}$ is the demographic projection matrix
and $\mathbf{x}_t$ is an age-structured vector of abundances at time $t$.
%
The projection matrix was defined as
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:matrix}
\mathbf{P}_{i,t} = 
\left[
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
    0             & 0             & 0             & \rho_{t}     \\
    \phi_{1,t}    & 0             & 0             & 0            \\
    0             & \phi_{2,t}    & 0             & 0            \\
    0             & 0             & \phi_{3,t}    & \phi_{4,t}
    \end{array}
\right]
\end{equation}
%
where $\rho_{t}$ is per capita recruitment and $\phi_{1,t}$ is the survival probability
of age class $i$. 
The model assumes that only individuals of age four or greater reproduce,
and also allows individuals return to the adult age class.
%
Temporal variation in recruitment was modeled as a random walk on a log scale to ensure
that the values remained positive:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rho}
\begin{aligned}
\text{log}\left(\rho_t\right) &= \text{log}\left(\rho_{t - 1}\right) + \epsilon_{\rho,t} \\
\epsilon_{\rho,t} &\sim \mathematical{N}\left(0, \sigma_{\rho} \right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
where $\epsilon_{\rho,t}$ is the random walk step at time $t$.
The steps of the random walk followed a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 
and standard deviation $\epsilon_{\rho,t}$.
Temporal variation in survival probability for age class $i$ was modeled analagously 
on a logit-scale:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:phi}
\begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\phi_{i, t}\right) &= \text{logit}\left(\phi_{i, t - 1}\right) +
                                          \epsilon_{\phi,i,t} \\
\epsilon_{\phi,i,t} &\sim \mathematical{N}\left(0, \sigma_{\phi} \right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\text{.}
%
Note that the random walks used to characterize the demographic parameters 
are not truly ``random'' as they are constrained by the data during model fitting.
Rather, they provided a convenient means 
of allowing the parameters to vary smoothly through time.

We paramterized the demographic model in a Bayesian framework, with likelihood
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:likelihood}
\mathcal{L} = 
\displaystyle\prod_{s}
\displaystyle\prod_{i}
\displaystyle\prod_{t}
\text{Poisson}
    \left(
        y_{s,i,t}~|~\gamma_i~\times~x_{i,t}
    \right)
\end{equation}
%
where $y_{s,i,t}$ is the annual catch for station $s$ and age class $i$,
and $\gamma_i$ is the age-specific detection probability.
Estimating a separate detection probability for each age class allowed the model to account
for systematic differences in catch rates as a function of age.
Such differences are quite apparent in the data, 
as far too few first year individuals are captured to account for the abundance subsequent
ages, assuming a closed population. 
Our model is similar to an N-mixture model, 
however it does not include an explicit binomial detection process.
We opted for the simpler approach because we encountered substantial convergence problems
when attempting to fit a proper N-mixture model.

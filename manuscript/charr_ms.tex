\section*{Abstract} \label{abstract}

Quantifying temporal variation in demographic rates is a central goal of population ecology,
in both basic and applied settings.
In this study, we analysed a multidecadal age-structured time series 
of arctic charr (\emph{Salvelinus alpinus}) catch  in Lake M\'{y}vatn, Iceland, 
to infer the time-varying demographic response of the population 
to reduced harvest in the wake of the fishery's collapse.
Our analysis shows that while survival probability of adults increased following the alleviation
of harvesting pressure, per recruitment consistent declined over the entire study period.
The countervailing demographic trends resulted 
in no directional change in the total population size or population growth rate.
Rather, the population dynamics were dominated by large interannual variability
and a shift towards a relatively older age distribution.
These results are indicative of a slow recovery of the population following its collapse,
despite the rising number of adults due to relaxed harvest.

\section*{Introduction}

Quantifying temporal variation in demographic rates is a central goal of population ecology,
as this underpins efforts to characterize both exogenous and endogenous drivers of population dynamics 
\citep{twombly1994comparative, zeng1998, koons2016life}.
However, this endeavor is challenging, 
as even the characterization of directional trends in demographic rates requires
data spanning many years and 
often relies on intensive mark-recpature (and related) approaches for statistical inference
\citep[e.g.,][]{forcada2008life, hunter2010climate}.
Both of these challenges are amplified in populations subject to large interannual variation
in demographic rates, 
which are often the targets of both basic and applied interest
\citep[e.g.,][]{white2007irruptive}.
Consequently, 
there is a need for addtional studies that 
explict quantify temporal variation in demographic rates 
and the resulting population dynamics, 
particularly for populations that have not been the subjects 
of intensive mark-recpature-style campaigns.

In this study, we analysed a multidecadal age-structured time series 
of arctic charr (\emph{Salvelinus alpinus}) catch  in Lake M\'{y}vatn, Iceland, 
to infer the time-varying demographic response of the population 
to reduced harvest in the wake of the fishery's collapse.
Arctic charr are salmonids with a circumpolar distribution
and are basis of numerous commerical fisheries \citep{klemetsen2003atlantic}.
Moreover,
arctic charr have important effects in many artic 
and boreal freshwater foodwebs owing to their roles as top consumers
\citep{jeppesen2001fish, klemetsen2003atlantic}.
In M\'{y}vatn, the charr sustained a large commerical fishery throughout much of the 
twentieth century that was subject to exploitation rates upwards of 80\%,
resulting in the fishery's collapse by the late 1980s \citep{gudbergsson2004}.
A monitoring program was instituted in 1986 to monitor the population's
response to declining harvesting pressure over the next few decades,
including catch restrictions imposed in the early 2000s.

Using these monitoring data, 
we parameterized an age-structured demographic model with time-varying recruitment and survival 
to charactreize the dynamics of the population.
We modeled temporal variation in the demgoraphic rates as random walks, 
an approach that had previously been applied 
to infer population growth rates from non-structured abundance 
\citep{zeng1998}
and for age-specific mortality rates inferred from fisheries stock assessments 
\citep{nielsen2014estimation}. 
This method takes advantage of the entire time series for estimating the parameters 
while allowing them to vary smoothly through time. 
Furthermore, the model is able to characterize a range of dynamics including those
arising from negative density-dependence and environmental perturbations.
The latter may be particularly important in the case of the M\'{y}vatn's charr,
as the lake is subject to large fluctuations in primary and secondary production
that may cascade up to the charr population 
\citep{einarsson2004myvatn, einarsson2004clad, gardarsson2004population}.
Accordingly, the purpose of our analysis is to 
(a) characterize interannual variability in survival recruitment 
in M\'{y}vatn's charr population 
and (b) determine whether directional trends in these demographic rates have
resulted in the recovery of the population in the wake of its collapse.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Study system} 
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

M\'{y}vatn is located in northeastern Iceland (65°40’N 17°00’W) 
and has a tundra-subarctic climate. 
The lake spans $37 \text{km}^2$, 
divided into north ($8 \text{km}^2$) and south ($29 \text{km}^2$) basins 
connected by a narrow channel \citep{einarsson2004myvatn}. 
M\'{y}vatn is shallow (south basin mean depth = 2.3m) and 
fed by nurient rich springs that sustain high benthic primary and secondary production.
The latter comprises large but temporally variable populations of benthic invertebrates 
such as midges and cladocerans \citep{einarsson2004clad, gardarsson2004population}.
The benthic invertebrates are in turn 
an important food source for M\'{y}vatn’s vertebrate populations, 
including Arctic charr, threespine stickleback (\emph{Gasterosteus aculeatus}), 
brown trout (\emph{Salmo trutta}), and waterfowl \citep{einarsson2004myvatn}. 

While some arctic charr populations are anadromous, 
M\'{y}vatn’s population to resides strictly within the lake, 
despite a major outflow that connects the lake to the Greenland Sea \citep{gudbergsson2004}. 
Spawning occurs in the fall among individuals aged 4 years and older. 
There are two charr morphs within M\'{y}vatn: ``regular'' (size at maturation of 35--50cm) 
and ``dwarf'' (20--25cm). However, the dwarf morph is restricted to a small 
and relatively isolated part of the south basin; therefore, 
the ``regular'' morph is the focus of this study. 
Gut content data reveal a diverse diet, including midges, snails, clams, zooplankton, 
benthic crustaceans, and sticklebacks. 
The large-bodied cladoceran Eurycercus is thought to be a particularly important prey item 
\citep{gudbergsson2004}. 
While some charr populations are cannibalistic \citep{klemetsen2003atlantic}, 
especially in the absence of other large-bodied prey (e.g., fish), 
the charr in M\'{y}vatn appear to lack cannibalism. 

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Data} 
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Systematic surveys of M\'{y}vatn’s Arctic charr have been conducted 
with gill nets every year from 1986-2020 by a single researcher (G. Gu{\dh}bergsson) 
using a consistent methodology. 
The surveys largely took place after the period of most dramatic population decline 
\citep{gudbergsson2004} 
and were intended to monitor the recovery of the population following its collapse. 
Eleven survey stations were sampled from around the lake,
most of which were located in the south basin. 
Captured individuals were aged either by otoliths directly or 
with an estimate based on length.
The surveys were conducted in fall (late August through September) 
of every year (just before spawning) and in June in a subset of years. 
For this analysis we used only the September data. 
Therefore, in our age classifications an individual of age ``x'' is an individual 
that survived to that age (e.g., an ``age 1'' individual was born in the previous fall). 
The oldest individuals in the data set were 12 years old, although observations 
of individuals older than 6 years are sparse
(Figure \ref{fig:p_cohort}). 
In M\'{y}vatn, charr reach maturity between 4 and 5 years of age, 
and therefore we grouped the older individuals into a single reproductive age class
denoted ``age 4+''.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Statistical analysis} 
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We characterized the demography of the charr population 
using an age-structured model \citep{caswell2001matrix}
with time-varying demographic rates \citep{zeng1998, nielsen2014estimation}.
The model projected the dynamics from one time step to the next as
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:XPX}
    \mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{P}_{t-1}~\mathbf{x}_{t-1}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathbf{P}_{t}$ is a demographic projection matrix,
and $\mathbf{x}_t$ is an age-structured vector of scaled population densities 
(see description of scaling below) at time $t$.
%
The projection matrix was defined as
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:matrix}
\mathbf{P}_{t} = 
\left[
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
    0             & 0             & 0             & \rho_{t}     \\
    \phi_{1,t}    & 0             & 0             & 0            \\
    0             & \phi_{2,t}    & 0             & 0            \\
    0             & 0             & \phi_{3,t}    & \phi_{4,t}
    \end{array}
\right]
\end{equation}
%
where $\rho_{t}$ is per capita recruitment 
and $\phi_{1,t}$ is the survival probability of age class $i$. 
The model assumes that only age 4+ is
and that individuals surviving beyond age 4 return to the age 4+ class.

Temporal variation in recruitment was modeled as a random walk on a log scale to ensure
that the values remained positive:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rho}
\begin{aligned}
\text{log}\left(\rho_t\right) &= \text{log}\left(\rho_{t - 1}\right) + \epsilon_{\rho,t} \\
\epsilon_{\rho,t} &\sim \text{Gaussian}\left(0, \sigma_{\rho} \right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
where $\epsilon_{\rho,t}$ is the random walk step at time $t$.
The steps of the random walk followed a Gaussian distribution with mean of 0 
and standard deviation (SD) of $\epsilon_{\rho,t}$.
Temporal variation in survival probability for age class $i$ was modeled analogously 
on a logit-scale:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:phi}
\begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\phi_{i, t}\right) &= \text{logit}\left(\phi_{i, t - 1}\right) +
                                          \epsilon_{\phi,i,t} \\
\epsilon_{\phi,i,t} &\sim \text{Gaussian}\left(0, \sigma_{\phi} \right)\text{.}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
with the same random walk SD used for all age classes 
to reduce the number of parameters fit by the model.
Note that the ``random walks'' used to characterize the demographic parameters 
do not necessarily possess the statistical properties 
of true random walks (e.g., non-stationarity) 
as they are constrained by the data during model fitting.
Rather, they provided a convenient means 
of allowing the parameters to vary smoothly through time.
The random walk SDs for recruitment and survival 
characterized the degree of temporal variation in the respective processes. 

We fit the model in a Bayesian framework with a zero-inflated Poisson likelihood:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:likelihood}
\mathcal{L} = 
\displaystyle\prod_{s}
\displaystyle\prod_{i}
\displaystyle\prod_{t}
\[ \begin{cases} 
      \theta + (1-\theta) \times \text{Poisson}
        \left(
            0~|~\kappa_i~\times~s~\times~x_{i,t}
        \right) & \text{if}~y_{s,i,t} = 0 \\
      (1-\theta) \times \text{Poisson}
        \left(
            y_{s,i,t}~|~\kappa_i~\times~s~\times~x_{i,t}
        \right) & \text{if}~y_{s,i,t} > 0
   \end{cases}
\]
\end{equation}
%
where $y_{s,i,t}$ is the annual catch for station $s$ and age class $i$,
$\kappa_i$ is the age-specific catch rate (constrained between 0 and 1),
$\theta$ is the probability of a zero from a Bernoulli sampling processes, and
$s=100$ is a scaling factor introduced to improve computationally efficiency
by preventing exessively large values of $x_{i,t}$ 
(such that $x_{i,t}$ itself is the population density scaled by $1/s$).
The likelihood implies that the station-level abundance follows a Poisson distribution
with a rate parameter equal to the lake-wide mean population density 
scaled by the catch rate for the corresponding age class.
We assumed that the lake-wide population was well mixed across years,
and while we did not attempt to account for systematic differences between stations;
no such differences were apparent from visual inspection of the data 
(Figure  \ref{fig:p_sites}; see discussion of potential overdispersion below).
Estimating a separate catch rate for each age class allowed the model to account
for systematic differences in catch rates as a function of age.
Such differences are quite apparent in the data, 
as far too few first-year individuals were captured to account for the abundance subsequent
ages, assuming a closed population. 
We used exponential priors with rate 1/50 for the initial scaled population densities for
each age class, 
Gaussian priors with mean 0 and SD of either 5 or 1 for 
initial log-recruitment or logit-survival (repsectively), 
Gamma priors with shape and scale both of 1.5 for the random walk SDs,
and Beta priors with shape parameters both of 2 for the catch rate.
Priors were selected to be weakly informative regarding overall scale, 
while not acting strongly against the likelihood in the posterior fit.

To assess temporal trends in the demographic rates, 
we used generalized least squares  (GLS) to fit lag-1 autoregressive models
with linear year effects.
Recruitment and survival probabilities were fit on their corresponding link scales 
(either log or logit),
and survival probabilities were fit for each age class separately.
We used a similar approach to estimate trends in the asymptotic population growth rate
(log scale), 
caclulated as the leading eigenvalue of projection matrix $\mathbf{P}_{t}$.
We performed this analysis on the asymptotic (as opposed to realized) growth rate 
as we were principally interersted in the effects 
of the underlying demographic rates per se; 
the realized growth rate would also have included transient fluctuations due to
non-equilibrium age structure.
For all GLS models, the response variables and year were z-scored 
(subtracted mean and divided by SD) so that coefficients
could be interpreted as effects sizes;
fitted values were then back-scaled for the figures.

The demographic model was fit using the statistical language Stan \citep{carpenter2017stan},
with 4 chains, 3000 iterations, maximumum tree depth set to 13, and adapt delta set to 0.95.
Convergence and quality of MCMC sampling were assessed using the diagnostics provided by Stan, 
incuding Rhat, the number of divergences, and the effective sample size.
We used posterior medians as point esitmates 
and the bounds of 68\% posterior quantiles as uncertainty intervals 
(hereafter $\text{UI}_{68\%}$), 
matching the nominal coverage of standard errors.
To gauge the degree to which the data were overdispersed relative 
the the model expectations, 
we simulated 90\% prediction intervals from equation \ref{eq:likelihood} 
and compared the coverage of these intervals to the data.
To assess the extent to which the data contained statistically meaningful information 
regarding temporal variation in the demographic rates,
we compared the fit of the full model to a reduced model with the demographic
rates fixed through time.
We implemented the Stan model fitting with the \texttt{rstan} package \citep{stan2020rstan},
performed GLS with the \texttt{gls} function from the \texttt{nlme} package \citep{pinheiro2020nlme}, 
and calculated the asymptotic growth rate with the \texttt{demogR} package \citep{holland2007demogR}.
All analysis were conducted in R 4.0.3 \citep{r2020}.

\section*{Results}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The full model provided a good visual fit to the station-level 
catch data (Figure \ref{fig:p_catch}),
with most of the temporal variation in lake-wide catch being captured by the model.
The 90\% prediction intervals provided reasonable coverage relative to the observed data,
although the observations were zero-inflated in some years.
While in principle it would be possible to account for such zero inflation in the model,
it is unlikely that this would substantively alter the model inference.
In contrast to the full model,
the reduced model provided a poor fit to the data (Figure \ref{fig:p_catch_reduced}),
displaying damped oscillations that did not reflect the observed dynamics
(Figure \ref{fig:p_dens_reduced}).
This was corroborated the median posterior log-likelihood calculated
from equation \ref{eq:likelihood},
which was much higher for the full model (-4826) than for the reduced (-7314).
According to the full model, 
the catch rates increased with age;
the catch rate for age 1 individuals was around two orders of magnitude lower
than for the other age classes (Table \ref{tab:param}). 
This is consistent with the expectation that age 1 individuals 
are generally too small to be captured by the gill nets used in the surveys.

M\'{y}vatn's arctic charr population fluctuated substantially over the 3-decade time series
(Figure \ref{fig:p_dens}), 
with the asymptotic population growth rate varying across an order of magnitude 
(Figure \ref{fig:p_lam}).
This variation was underpinned by substantial variation in survival 
(Figure \ref{fig:p_surv}) 
and recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:p_rec}),
both of which had random walk SDs 
with posterior densities concentrated away from zero (Table \ref{tab:param}).
The SD for survival as larger than for recruitment,
especially when the SDs were judged against the scales of their corresponding 
demographic processes. 
This indicates that survival was generally more variable than recruitment,
a fact that was visually apparent from their respective time series
(Figures \ref{fig:p_surv} and \ref{fig:p_rec}),
especially for age 1 and age 3 survival.

The survival probabilities for all age classes increased through time,
although only the trend for age 4+ was statistically unambiguous 
(Figure \ref{fig:p_surv}; Table \ref{tab:gls}).
Elevated age 4+ survival was associated with a steady increase in the catch of
age 4+ individuals from 2005 onward (Figure \ref{fig:p_catch}). 
In contrast, per capita recruitment declined through time, 
consistent with declining age 1 catch,
and this trend was stronger than for survival of any age class
(Figure \ref{fig:p_rec}; Table \ref{tab:gls}).
Therefore, the positive effect of increased survival 
was potentially negated by the decline in recruitment.
Indeed, the geometric mean of the population growth rate across years was very close to one
(0.99 [0.970, 1.02]), indicating no long-term population change.
Furthermore, there was no clear trend in the population growth rate itself,
despite its large interannual fluctuations
(Figure \ref{fig:p_lam}; Table \ref{tab:gls}).
The AR coefficients were moderately positive for most of the demographic parameters,
except for age 2 survival and the population growth rate 
for which the AR coefficients were slightly negative.
These negative coefficients potentially indicate overcompensatory dynamics,
although this inference is quite tentative given their low magnitudes 
and absence of uncertainty estimates.
Overall, the GLS results show that while the arctic charr population was very dynamic
over the study period, it did not undergo meaningful directional change.

\section*{Discussion}

In this study, 
we used data from a multidecadal survey of arctic charr in Lake M\'{y}vatn
to quantify the population's demography and potential recovery 
following its collapse due to heavy exploitation 
\citep{gudbergsson2004}.
The survival probability of all age classes fluctuated substantially among years,
with only adults showing an unambiguous positive trend over the course of the study period.
In contrast, per capita recruitment clearly declined and experienced comparatively little
variation around this trend.
The countervailing changes in  per capita recruitment and adult survival resulted 
in no directional change in the total population size or population growth rate,
despite the rising number of adults.
Rather, the dynamics of  M\'{y}vatn's charr population 
were dominated by large interannual variability
and a shift towards a relatively older age distribution.
In and of itself, the increase in adult survival 
is a positive signal for the population's recovery,
and it has been taken as such by the local stakeholders 
who have called for relaxing harvest restrictions in recent years.
However, persistently low recruitment provides a cautionary note 
that should be taken into consideration in formulating a management strategy.

A crucial step for projecting the future dynamics of M\'{y}vatn’s charr population 
is identifying the underlying causes for the decline in per capita recruitment.
Food web interactions have been identified as an important source 
of fluctuations in other charr populations 
\citep{snorrason1992population, amundsen1994piscivory, jonsson2015freshwater}.
M\'{y}vatn is characterized by dramatic fluctuations in the abundance 
of primary food sources for juvenile charr, particularly benthic crustaceans 
and midges 
\citep{einarsson2004clad, gardarsson2004population, gudbergsson2004}.
Furthermore, there is substantial spatial heterogeneity in the abundance 
of these aquatic invertebrates \citep{bartrons2015spatial} 
which might disproportionately inhibit young juveniles 
that have more restricted mobility than the larger age classes. 
The large fluctuations in aquatic invertebrates are associated various consumer species 
in addition to charr, including sticklebacks and brown trout that could serve 
as competitors for young charr, and piscivorous waterfowl that could serve as predators 
\citep{einarsson2004myvatn}. 
In addition to biotic factors, 
temperature has received much attention as a driver of charr populations 
\citep{winfield2008arctic, elliott2010temperature, jonsson2015freshwater},
given their distribution restricted to arctic
and cold-temperature lakes \citep{klemetsen2003atlantic}
and the ubiquity anthropogenic climate change. 
While climate warming has not yet become an obvious ecological driver at M\'{y}vatn, 
it is nonetheless possible that temperature changes have adversely affected recruitment 
in M\'{y}vatn’s charr population as has been seen in other Icelandic lakes 
\citep{malmquist2009salmonid}. 

This study provides a demographic assessment of a population of arctic charr in a single lake,
but it reinforces themes that have broad and increasing interest in applied ecology.
Harvest-induced shifts in age structure have been documented in other fisheries,
typically resulting in ``truncation'' of the oldest age classes 
that are typically the targets of harvest efforts
\citep{hsieh2010fishing}.
Suppression of adult abundance is expected to have deleterious effects on populations,
with the corollary that relaxation of harvest should allow populations 
to recover following overexploitation.
However, this will only be true if juvenile recruitment is sufficient 
to sustaining the population's recovery.
Recruitment in fish populations 
has long been recognized as highly variable and difficult to predict
owing to the interplay of numerous biotic and abiotic factors 
\citep{dixon1999episodic, houde2008emerging, ludsin2014physical}.
This poses a particular challenge for management efforts, 
as complex suites of ecological factors are both difficult to understand 
and difficult to regulate, 
particularly in comparison to a direct anthropogenic driver such as harvest
\citep{beamish1999taking, link2002does}.
The extent to which this is true for M\'{y}vatn's arctic charr is currently unknown.
Nonetheless, 
the countervailing trends in survival and recruitment 
in the wake of alleviated of harvesting pressure
underscore the potential for heterogeneous demographic responses to management efforts
due to the complex ecological context in which such efforts take place.

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:gls}
Coefficients and standard errors (SE) from the GLS models 
quantifying linear trends in the demographic rates through time.
The models were fit on either a log (recruitment; population growth rate)
or logit (survival probability) scale,
and all response and predictor variables were z-scored prior to model fitting.
Therefore, the coefficients can be compared as effect sizes 
across all of the response variables.
The autoregressive (AR) coefficients were included to account for temporal autocorrelation
when estimating the year trends;
0 indicates no autocorrelation, 
while |1| indicates strong (positive or negative) autocorrelation 
and statistical non-stationarity.

The solid black line represents the fitted values from the GLS model
fit on a log-scale and then back-transformed
